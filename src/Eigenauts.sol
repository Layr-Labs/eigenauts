// Eigenauts
//
// This ERC721 NFT collection is a private collection that is
// designed to build community within the Eigen Layer effort, and
// ultimately, the ecosystem. Eventually this contract will be upgraded
// out of centralized control into a lightweight self-governing system
// of Keys - still mutable but governed by the Eigenaut holders.
//
// The key and NFT system are designed to enable seemless extensions
// of the NFT capabilities, so this contract will mainly focus
// on managing the population of the Eigenaut commmunity, and their
// governing rites. Other functions like badge management, game participation,
// or other extensions to what the Eigenauts are capable of will
// be delivered as extensible contracts.
//
// The main features of the Eigenaut contracts are:
//
// 1) Seeding the initial population of Eigenauts for genesis.
// 2) Setting governance roles for the community.
// 3) Minting new Eigenauts, and the rules around that.
// 4) Migrating or moving Eigenauts safely to new wallets.
